    "    - Reason: Structural. All related to general internal or external loans, so missing means the applicant just doesn't have history with a specific type of loan or has unknown information.\n",
    "    - Solution: Impute with 0. There is enough information in these columns worth keeping (compared to credit). Imputing with 0 paired with the flags for these loans being 0 should allow the models to pick up on differences between no debt history vs. paid off debt for example.\n",
